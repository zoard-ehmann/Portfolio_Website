  <h2 class="display-5 my-main__title--bold mb-4">UI Design</h2>
  <p class="lead">Building static or dynamic websites by using the basic skill set in the field of UI design. Static websites can be made only with layout and styling. Dynamic websites requires some functionality as well for the animations and interactions with the user.</p>
  <p class="lead">The default layout and content is made with HTML5 markup language. HTML can support accessibility and SEO with the appropriate semantics.</p>
  <p class="lead">Styling can be applied with either CSS3 or Bootstrap. CSS is a really flexible style sheet language and enables fully customization on the website, however the development could take a long time due to all the styling has to be done from scratch. On the other hand, Bootstrap is a framework for CSS with predefined classes. The development time is much faster and the outcome is a responsive and polished website. Bootstrap styling can be customized with CSS as well which allows the design to be outstanding from the rest Bootstrap sites.</p>
  <p class="lead">JavaScript is a scripting language and responsible for website interactions and functionality, such as animations, pop-up messages and managing dynamic content. JavaScript runs directly in the browser on client-side. JavaScript has a framework called jQuery which can reduce the code size and development time by using a library of functions. Because of the quantity of imported libraries, jQuery could put more load on the website though.</p>
  <p class="lead">I learned these UI design during online courses and tried to incorporate them in my daily projects, like this website. They also help me in the field of WordPress development and lets me to build customized themes or modify the existing styling of the components.</p>

  <h2 class="display-5 my-main__title--bold mb-4">Web Development</h2>
  <p class="lead">Web development skills can be used for a plenty of projects, mainly for websites and web applications. This knowledge includes back-end and front-end languages and frameworks, databases for full-stack applications and content management systems (CMS) as well.</p>
  <p class="lead">I'm familiar with the Linux OS as an underlying system and the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) for full-stack web applications. I used this stack for smaller student projects during my education. I've got experience with WordPress development also where I can use both the WordPress theme builder plugins and I can develop custom themes and plugins on my own.</p>
  <p class="lead">I'm working mainly in a containerized environment using Docker with Linux OS to ensure my applications are secure and independent from the host machine and each other. This way the applications can run on any machine where the Docker is installed. The MERN stack fits perfectly in a containerized environment also, each micro-service has its own environment, thus they won't conflict. For back-end, I'm using Mongo DB as a database, because the NoSQL mechanism suits well for JSON data. Node JS works perfectly with Mongo DB and it's a versatile framework based on JavaScript for back-end processing. Express JS is an additional robust framework for Node JS and it is designed to build APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end. As a front-end framework, I'm using React JS which based on JavaScript as well. It's component based where components can manage their own state which makes it easy to create interactive user interfaces.</p>
  <p class="lead">For website development, I'm using mainly WordPress, because it has a complete content management system (CMS) and a lot of features built in. CMS lets the user to modify the appearance and the contents on the website. Plugins and themes makes it easy to create a website quickly either from templates or from scratch using a theme builder. There's a possibility for complete customization as well. In this case, WordPress theme and plugins (if they are required) have to be developed manually by writing code. WordPress uses MySQL as a database and PHP as a base language in the back-end. There are many opportunities to use in the front-end (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React, etc.) to design the user interface.</p>

  <h2 class="display-5 my-main__title--bold mb-4">Programming</h2>
  <p class="lead">I'm working mainly with Python as a programming language. Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language and a really versatile, general-purpose tool which can be used for various type of applications. It has an easy-to-read syntax which can lead to a clear, logical code for both small and large projects.</p>
  <p class="lead">It is recognized in the field of data science and machine learning. It is possible to build graphical user interfaces (GUI) and desktop applications as well with Python. It is widely known in the field of website and web application programming. Django is a popular, high-level Python framework which helps rapid development using clean code. Python can be found in the video game industry, it is possible to build smaller games as well. It has a lot of modern frameworks which can make the development process easier and more polished.</p>
  <p class="lead">I'm still actively learning Python during a coding challenge where I have to create a smaller project every day from scratch. During the course, I'm learning about new concepts each day and I have to apply it in practice as well. This kind of approach helps me to understand how and when should I use the different methods to get the desired outcome.</p>
